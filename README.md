A Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox extention that does not suck!!, i hope.


# Development
### How to run
1. Start the development product page  
 ```bash
  npm run serve
 ```

2. Start Mozilla Firefox extension development, this will open up Firefox and launch the product demo on `http://localhost:9000/`
 ```bash
  npm run serve:firefox`
 ```

 3. It can be tedious to manually reload the extension, so to hot reload the extendsion files, open a new terminal and run. 
 ```bash
  npm run watch
 ```
